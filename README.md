# HighRise-circular-linked-list
High-Rise Simulation is a C++ program that uses a circular linked list to model residents in a luxury tower. Through a Josephus-style elimination process, residents are removed one by one until only a single survivor remains, blending data structures with a dark, story-driven simulation.
